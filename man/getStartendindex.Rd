\title{Function to match pixels to their corresponding polygon}
\usage{
getStartendindex(covariates, polygon_data, id_var = "area_id")
}
\arguments{
\item{covariates}{data.frame with each covariate as a column an and id column}

\item{polygon_data}{data.frame with polygon id and response data}

\item{id_var}{string with the name of the column in the covariate data.frame containing the polygon id}
}
\description{
From the covaraite data and polygon data, the function matches the polygon id between the two to find 
which pixels from the covariate data are contained in each of the polygons
}
\details{
Takes a data.frame containing the covariate data with a polygon id column and one column for each covariate, 
and another data.frame containing polygon data with a polygon id, response and sample size column (as returned 
by \code{getPolygonData} function)

Returns a matrix with two columns and one row for each polygon. The first column is the index of the first row in
covariate data that corresponds to that polygon, the second column is the index of the last row in
covariate data that corresponds to that polygon.

{
 covs <- data.frame(area_id = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3), response = c(3, 9, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 3, 5))
 response <- data.frame(area_id = c(1, 2, 3), response = c(4, 7, 2), N = c(NA, NA, NA))
 getStartendindex(covs, response, 'area_id')
